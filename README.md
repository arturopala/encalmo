_What the project does, the problem it solves, etc._

   Encalmo is a Scala library designed to facilitate modeling and documenting of recurrent engineering calculations.
   * Goal: You are modeling calculations but Encalmo does it for you and document, step by step, in a pretty way (html + mathml, pdf, latex and so on).
   * Range of applications: real-life and educational structural engineering calculations

_Why it does it this way, benefits and drawbacks_

   Enclamo uses powers of the Scala language:

  * DSL capabilities (operator is a method, space instead of dot operator, implicit conversions, objects, default parameters) for easy-to-read and friendly (mathematical) appearance of user's code
  * flexible type system, pattern matching, implicits and collections for easy modeling of transformations and calculations under the hood

_Instructions that detail how the project is compiled, deployed and used._

   In the current phase Encalmo is a scala library, operated with unit tests :-), in the future combined with dedicated web gui.
